### Me

Hi, I'm `Hantz (errpell)`. I'm a Computer Engineering undergraduate at
[UdeS](https://www.usherbrooke.ca/about/). I am from Haiti and currently live in
Montr√©al.

I see programming as the main tool I can currently use to realize my ideas. I
enjoy developing software with a variety of platforms and languages.

I use C++, Python, and Java to concretize my ideas. I'm also interested in
languages that present programming from a completely new angle. Among those are
D-Lang, Perl and Lisp(s).

I know my way around a Unix like environment. I prefer using Linux on my main
computer. I'm comfortable using established development tools like Git and Bash
in my workflow. I prefer working on open platforms and care about Free Libre and
Open Source Software.

I take part in Game-jams and Hackathons when possible. I otherwise spend my free
time creating or improving the tools I find useful. I'm open to contribute to
the development of new ones.

I am an avid reader. I consume media from various genres and periods. The works
of Jacques Roumain, Rohinton Mistry, and Denis Villeneuve, to cite a few, have
moved me.

I also try to write. I have a few unpublished short works of fiction. I keep my
analysis and commentaries on various events in writing. I also enjoy blogging
about the technologies that I find exciting. I have published and will continue
to make some of those texts available here.

I am a self-described Marxist. Marxism offers the most comprehensive method for
analyzing and solving today's problems.

Vulnerable people on the planet are those who matter the most to me. Improving
their situation is a key aspect of my life project. I will use technical and
societal means to enact lasting change in their lives, from many fronts. Those
include improvements in human-computer interactions; and accessibility,
portability, and re-usability of knowledge.

I am available to discuss any topic over email. This is where I rant and pretend
to know stuff. Welcome to my Ted Talk.
