### Me

Hi, I'm `errpell`. I'm a Computer Science student, in cegep.
And a soon to be Computer Engineering undergraduate. I enjoy 
pretending to working with C++ and other powerful
languages. I'm also a reader and a wannabe writer. This is where
I rant, and pretend to know stuff. Welcome to my show.


### The name

You can read RPL as __err-p-ell__ or __rant, pretend, learn__. Up to you buddy.
