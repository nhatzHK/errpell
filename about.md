### Me

Hi, I'm `Hantz`. I'm a Computer Engineering undergraduate at
[UdeS](https://www.usherbrooke.ca/about/). 

I enjoy embedded, desktop as well as graphic applications development using
C++, Python and Java. I'm also interested in languages with interesting design
decisions like D-lang, Perl and Lisp(s).

I know my way around a Unix like environment and I'm comfortable using established
dev tools like Git and Bash in my workflow. I enjoy working on open platforms
and care deeply about FLOSS.

I spend my free time reading Orwell, watching Villeneuve's, participating in
GameJams and Hackathons when I'm not creating or improving the tools I find
useful. I also try to write.

Improving the situation of the most vulnerable people on the planet is a key
aspect of my life project. The paths I take (or intend to take) working toward
that goal comprise comprise improvement of human-computer interaction; improvement of
accessibility, portability and reusability of knowledge as well as volunteer
work on projects and in communities that I care about.

This is where I rant, and pretend to know stuff. Welcome to my Ted Talk.
